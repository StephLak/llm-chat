# worklyn_task
An LLM App.

## Getting Started
* Run "flutter pub get" to fetch dependencies
* Run "flutter run" to run the app

## How To Use the App
* Firstly, enter any message in the prompt
* After getting the first response, enter your name
* Then you can ask questions that would return LLM Response specifically 
    with numbering order to generate tasks, else it would show the response as a text
* Errors are properly handled in case of LLM response not accounted for as at the
    moment of development
* Once the tasks are generated, then you can go ahead to modify the dates by selecting
    the Today, Tomorrow and No Date button or by choosing a date on the displayed calendar
* Also, the task can be deleted when you click on the delete text
